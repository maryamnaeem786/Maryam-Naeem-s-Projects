Project: Detecting Fraud in Financial Transactions: A machine learning approach

In this project, I developed a TensorFlow-based AI model to detect fraudulent bank transactions, emphasizing data visualization, preprocessing, and class balancing during initial stages. The model, which incorporated two hidden layers utilized binary cross-entropy and the Adam optimizer for effective learning. Performance evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix, along with SHAP for model interpretability, ensured a comprehensive understanding of the model's decision-making process and its effectiveness in identifying fraudulent activities in bank transactions.
